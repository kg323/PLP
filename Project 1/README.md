# **PLP Project 1: LED Counter** 

**Learning Objectives:** 

● Become familiar with PLPTool features 

● Use PLP arithmetic and control flow instructions 

● Write to a memory mapped I/O device 


**The Task:**

Write a program in PLP assembly that counts up by one starting from zero (or one) inside a loop and writes this 
value  to  the  LEDs  every  time  the  value  is  increased.  The  memory  address  of  the  LEDs  is  0xf0200000.  The  table 
below  shows  the  meaning  and  an  example  usage  of  the  instructions  covered  in  the  video,  PLP  Instructions  for 
Project 1.

The  image  below  shows  the  buttons that will  allow  you  to enter  simulation mode,  view  the  LEDs,  and  run  your 
program. Two things to keep in mind regarding simulation mode: 

1. Simulation controls will, such as run, are only visible when simulation mode has been toggled on. 

2. The program cannot be edited while simulation mode is toggled on.
